AI-Powered Citizen Access & Process Navigator
Hackathon Submission Summary

🏆 Problem Statement

Millions of citizens in India struggle to access government schemes and complete public-service processes — not because services don’t exist, but because:

Information is scattered across portals like UMANG and MyGov

Eligibility rules are complex and non-personalized

Required documents are unclear

Processes vary by state/district

Citizens depend on middlemen who charge money or mislead them

Low digital literacy makes navigation difficult

As a result, eligible citizens fail to access benefits designed for them.

The system helps users:

Discover eligibility for government schemes and benefits

Understand step-by-step processes for public services

Validate documents before submission

Find relevant local offices

Avoid scams and misinformation

Our assistant simplifies complex government systems into clear, actionable guidance.
